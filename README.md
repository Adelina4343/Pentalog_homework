# Pentalog Homework

I put all the projects on the netlify server for hosting. The link is in the folder with the number of homework.
Here I show you how to run a local server to view the change in real time.

## How to use

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/Adelina4343/Pentalog_homework.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd Pentalog_homework
    ```

3.  **Install `live-server` (if not already installed):**

    ```bash
    npm install --save-dev live-server
    ```

4.  **Start `live-server`:**

    ```bash
    npx live-server
    ```

    This will start a local server and automatically open the website in your default browser. Usually, it will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Notes

*   `live-server` will automatically reload the web page in your browser every time you save changes to your project files.
*   You can configure `live-server` using a `live-server.config.js` configuration file in your project directory. See the `live-server` documentation for more information: <https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server>
